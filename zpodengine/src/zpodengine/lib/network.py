# All networks from the main network
# This is to provide VLAN support in every zPod for ease of use
# and better UX when simulating on-prem env.
# We defaulted each of them to a /26 network
# This means we will have 4 x /26 usable in the zPod
# The first /26 will be managed by the Native VDS/NSX-T Segment
# The last 3 x /26 will be managed by zbox/vyos through guest VLANs
# Example:
# zpod_subnet = 10.96.50.0/24
# provides:
# - 10.96.50.0/26   [VDS/NSX-T on native vlan (no tagging)]
# - 10.96.50.64/26  [zbox/vyos on vlan 64]
# - 10.96.50.128/26 [zbox/vyos on vlan 128]
