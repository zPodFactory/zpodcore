# zPod SDK

This is the zPod SDK. It is self-generated, we should not commit anything in this folder for now.

## Getting Started

You will be able to generate the zpodsdk python bindings by running the following commands:

```bash
just zpodapi-generate-openapi
just zpodsdk-build
```

This will generate the openapi.json file and then build the python bindings using a dedicated container configured with the correct tooling. (zpodsdk_builder)

Sample output:

```bash
zpodcore on main [?‚á°] via üê≥ desktop-linux
‚ùØ just zpodapi-generate-openapi
docker exec -t zpodapi python zpodapi/scripts/openapi/generate_openapi_json.py
Generating openapi.json...

zpodcore on main [?‚á°] via üê≥ desktop-linux
‚ùØ just zpodsdk-build
cp -vf zpodapi/scripts/openapi/openapi.json zpodsdk_builder/openapi.json
zpodapi/scripts/openapi/openapi.json -> zpodsdk_builder/openapi.json
docker build -t zpodfactory/zpodsdk_builder zpodsdk_builder
